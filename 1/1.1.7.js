/*
    Example: Square Roots by Newton's Method

    -there is an important difference between mathematical functions 
    and computer functions
    -consider the problem of computing square roots

    we can define a square-root functio as:
    the square root of x equals y such that y is greater than or equal to
    zero and y squared equals x.

    in pseudo:
    function sqrt(x) {
        return the y with y >= 0 &&  square(y) === x
    }

    -mathematical functions describe properties of things (declarative knowledge)
    -computer functions describe how to how to do something (imperative knowledge)
